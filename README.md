# **Value at Risk (VaR)** Analysis of Nifty50 Portfolio

This project provides a comprehensive **Value at Risk (VaR)** analysis for an equally weighted portfolio of Nifty50 stocks. The analysis is performed using three widely accepted methods: Variance-Covariance, Historical Simulation, and Monte Carlo Simulation. The project is implemented in Python and leverages daily adjusted closing prices sourced from Yahoo Finance.

# **Project Overview**

## Objective: Quantify the market risk of a Nifty50 portfolio using VaR.

## Portfolio: Equally weighted, comprising all available Nifty50 stocks.

## Data Source: Yahoo Finance (daily adjusted close prices).

## Analysis Period: 2023-08-29 to 2024-08-29.

# **VaR Methods:**

1. Variance-Covariance
2. Historical Simulation
3. Monte Carlo Simulation

# **Features**

1. Robust handling of ticker failuresâ€”stocks with missing data are excluded automatically.
2. Calculation of daily returns for each stock.
3. Construction of an equally weighted portfolio.
4. VaR calculation at user-defined confidence levels.
5. Visualization of Monte Carlo results using Matplotlib.
